## Example

Here's a straightforward example of how to request data with the wrapper.

client.get_bot("1234").defAvatar
# returns

### Auto Posting

The library provides you with autoposting functionality, and autoposts at an interval of 30 minutes.
Here's how you can use it

```ruby
require 'topgg'
require 'discordrb'

bot = Discordrb::Bot.new token: "TOKEN"

client = Topgg.new("AUTH_TOKEN", "BOTID")
 bot.ready do |event|
 client.auto_post_stats(bot) # The discordrb bot client.
end
bot.run
```
